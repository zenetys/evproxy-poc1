This is an rsyslog to elasticsearch update proxy for monitoring events.
It receives monitoring events sent from rsyslog in HTTP through omelasticsearch,
then sends updates to elasticsearch.

Goal: hypervisor for monitoring events

TODO, ideas:
- put events in queues, ZeroMQ, Redis, ...
- queue workers to consume events (scale on several instances)
- alerts confirmation, problem duration
- notifications
- workflow for metrics indexation (ES, InfluxDB, Prometheus, ...)
- metrics based events, watch (Prometheus integration for instance)

Indexation:
- Should we absolutely minimize application joins?
- Query example: i:192.168.1.28 & t:Linux
- IP and type fields should be on a device object only
